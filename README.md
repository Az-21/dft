iDFT Calculator and Visualizer is an assist tool for college level students enrolled in digital signal subjects. The aim of this calculator is to help students cross-verify their DFT, IDFT, and Rx2FFT problems.

## Features
- Dynamic list of n-points: add or remove points in an intuitive way.
- Supported operations: DFT, IDFT, and Rx2 FFT.
- Padding safety: automatically pad the input signal to 2^n when calculating FFT using Rx2 algorithm.
- Interactive output signal visualization on a stem-graph.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcomed, but please know this project is built using _Vibes_ â„¢ architecture. I made it when I was still learning Flutter, so it its pretty hard to refactor stuff without breaking something. I did a lot of cleanup when I resumed working on this app to support Material You, but overall the codebase is still a mess.
